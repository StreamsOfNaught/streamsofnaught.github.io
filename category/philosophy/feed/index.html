<p>When the development of artificial intelligence was still gaining traction, there were ethical questions raised about the creation of an AI that is conscious like us, humans. Whether or not it is possible to create one is a whole another question, but the experts wondered if it would be ethical to bring something like that into this world. What if the AI is susceptible to some kind of suffering? The creators would then be responsible for all the suffering that it would experience, as the AI wouldn’t have suffered if it was not brought into existence in the first place. There is also no way of knowing the degree of suffering it could possibly experience.</p>



<p>What they were considering was purely hypothetical, but it made me wonder, how often do we ask these questions when we create life? When parents decide to bring a child into this world, do they really think about all the suffering that their child might experience throughout the lifetime? Are they willing to take that responsibility? Is it really ethical to create something so magnificent yet so fragile — a being that is susceptible to all kinds of pain and suffering, both physical and&nbsp;psychological?</p>



<p>While I do not know the answers to these questions, but as beings who are capable of asking and answering such questions, I do not think we are asking these questions as much as we should be. We should be very cautious of making decisions in the name of tradition or for our own selfishness, until we truly understand and accept the true scale and severity of their implications. Life is indeed beyond beautiful in its full glory, but it is unfair in unimaginable ways too. Not everyone will experience the same amount of joy, and likewise, not everyone will experience the same amount of pain. Some will live happily, while others will be tormented every second of their lives. It could a birth defect, a severe mental illness, a terminal disease or even trauma, and sometimes the suffering comes from the parent’s failure to take proper care of the child. This is the truth of life and it is a burden that every creator must bear.</p>



<p>It is also true that ethical questions of this level are not easy to answer. But the more we become aware of the consequences of our seemingly harmless actions, the better we are able to mitigate unnecessary suffering in this world. Perhaps this is why we should strive towards creating a fairer and just world, so that no one would be left behind, and everyone could equally experience the joy and beauty of life. And perhaps then, answering these questions wouldn’t be so difficult after all.</p>
